This is one user's ./configure invocation, that worked on OpenBSD.

Certainly the pathnames may differ, but the general idea is clear:  Set
CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and other environment vars as needed, prior to
./configure invocation.

AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.11 AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.68 ./autogen.sh && \
CC=clang LD=llvm-ld CFLAGS='-O2 -Wall -g' \
 LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/lib' \
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/OpenBSD/5.1/amd64/libbitc-0.0 && \
      make all check
